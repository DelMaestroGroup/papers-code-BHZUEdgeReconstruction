### Abstract
We study interaction-driven edge reconstruction in a quantum spin Hall insulator described by the BHZ model with Kanamoriâ€“Hubbard interactions using real-space density matrix renormalization group method in both the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles. 
For a two-dimensional cylinder with one smooth edge, we identify discrete particle-number transitions that lead to spin-polarized edge states stabilized by an emergent ferromagnetic exchange interaction. The reconstruction is orbital-selective, occurring predominantly in the $s$-orbital channel. Our results reveal a fully microscopic mechanism for emergent spin polarization at the edge that could compromise the topological protection of helical edge states by time reversal symmetry.
